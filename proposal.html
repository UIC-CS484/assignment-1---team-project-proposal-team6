                    <p class = "response">Anyone who likes listening to music, however, their music exists on different playforms. Our site will give them the option to be able to merge their playlists and have a singular platform for all their music needs</p>

                    <p>What are the goals of your site? Provide a minimum of 2 goals.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To be able to authenticate users securely and be able to display all basic information of the user than provide some graphical data.</li>
                        <li>To create a dynamic video player that can adjust to the song source as necessary. If a song is not found from one source, you have two other sources to search from.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>Why did your team select this topic?</p>
                    <p class = "response">We choose this topic because we both like listening to a lot of music, however some artists are platform independent. So in order to listen to some artists, we have to either go to youtube and listen and then switch to maybe spotify for another artist. This solution would allow us to have 1 platform for all music</p>
