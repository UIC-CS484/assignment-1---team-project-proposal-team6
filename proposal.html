                    <p>Why did your team select this topic?</p>
                    <p class = "response">We choose this topic because we both like listening to a lot of music, however some artists are platform independent. So in order to listen to some artists, we have to either go to youtube and listen and then switch to maybe spotify for another artist. This solution would allow us to have 1 platform for all music</p>
